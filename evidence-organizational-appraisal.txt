- *Our situation:* Good industry comparisons and benchmarks provided

**Barrier 5: Measurement Error**
- *What it means:* Difference between what we measure and what's actually true
- *Risk Level:* Medium
- *Our situation:* Industry averages may not match individual business experiences

**Barrier 6: Small Sample Problem**
- *What it means:* Unreliable conclusions from too few examples
- *Risk Level:* Medium
- *Our situation:* Industry-wide data reduces this risk, but applying to one business is uncertain

**Barrier 7: Confusing Percentages**
- *What it means:* Mixing up different types of percentage changes
