- **Industry Focus:** [Estheticain - Skin and Lash services]

### Interview Responses:
1.) I have been an esthetician at Lotus Wellness Spa since August of 2025! I also take clients at my house doing lash lift and tints on the side!

2.) at the spa, we haven't experienced much retention yet because we just opened in August of 2025! But we have had clients come from The healing touch spa over the Lotus because of the previous estheticians there! My retention at home is about 75%, some women have wanted their lashes done for vacation but most want to keep coming back to maintain the lift consistently!

3.) With lash lift and tints it's been prettytt steady at home, I just started doing them at the Spa so I haven't noticed any people come back yet for those but I haven't had a few random clients come back for facials!

4.) my problem might be that I am a beginner and might not know certain techniques that people have known since they have been in the game longer! and some people are taking advantage of the grand opening deals going on around here and we get people from massanutten and other surrounding areas like new market.

5.) I think it's pretty common especially for other new spas opening up currently in the area!!!! We also have a lot of beginners in the area so clients have a lot of other options to go to as well!

6.) I have seen that little things that you do work well for client retention. I wanna incorporate a lash loyalty card for future 10% off or even pre booking so it's already in the works.

6.) For example I give a scalp massage while the tint is sitting so I'm not just doing nothing. Or I double cleanse the lashes while some lash techs just put primer on for lashes

7.) all the ones I mentioned above are really good tips to keep clients and to make sure you have a clean space and are sterilizing properly and disinfecting EVERYTHING!!!

8.) Challenges would be making sure that people don't cheat it if you are doing a punch card. Benefits would definitely be increased client retention and incentive for others.

9.) if I were to have the challenge of someone cheating the punch card system then I would just make sure to change up the punch pin to make sure it's custom.

10.) resources like YouTube, Reddit, and Instagram is really useful. I love YouTube for a lot of free resources and it's awesome to definitely take advantage of free courses as well and buying bulk items with ur license to not spend as much money.

11.) I don't have anything else to note

#### About Solutions
Personal touches and extra service details matter most, loyalty programs and pre-booking systems help, consistency in follow-up communication is critical

#### About Implementation
Start with small service improvements immediately, focus on cleanliness and professionalism, invest time in building genuine relationships with clients

### Divergent Perspectives
