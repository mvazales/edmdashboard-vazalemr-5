2. **Randomized Controlled Trials** [High quality]
3. **Quasi-experimental Studies** [Medium-high quality]
4. **Cohort Studies** [Medium quality]
5. **Cross-sectional Studies** [Medium-low quality]
6. **Case Studies** [Lower quality but valuable for context]

### Quality Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Clear research question
- [ ] Appropriate methodology
- [ ] Adequate sample size
- [ ] Valid measurement tools
- [ ] Appropriate statistical analysis
- [ ] Clear reporting of results
- [ ] Discussion of limitations
- [ ] Peer-reviewed publication

## Documentation Process
[Saving relevant studies within EBSCO and taking notes on necessary qualitiative/quantitiative aspects.]

### Reference Management
[Citations will be pasted here: ]

### Evidence Extraction Form
[What information you'll record for each study]
- Citation details
- Study design and methodology
- Sample characteristics
- Key findings
- Relevance to your problem/solution
- Quality assessment

## Challenges and Limitations
[Extrmeley limited information on the problem framework in 
regars to the beauty industry, still limited when looking outside of it, 
almost none of the research is performed in the US. Limited metrics on current 
state of the industry]

### Search Limitations
[Hardly any information on beauty industry related studies]

### Resource Constraints
