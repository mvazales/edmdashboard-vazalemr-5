# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering internal organizational evidence

Key Limitations
No Direct Loyalty Program Tracking: Government datasets don't directly measure loyalty program effectiveness
Industry Granularity: Beauty industry data often aggregated with broader service categories
Customer-Level Data: Most datasets focus on business/establishment level, not individual customer behavior
Temporal Gaps: Economic Census conducted every 5 years; other surveys have quarterly/annual cycles
Proxy Variables: Must use employment stability, revenue growth, and spending patterns as retention proxies

## Internal Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** [Current client retention and client churn rates in the industry]
**Secondary Goal:** [Internal organizational capacity and readiness to implement customer loyalty programs in beauty service establishments]

- **Employee turnover rates (Consensus):**
 - Consensus:
 Data Gaps
Lack of Published US Rates: No study provides a specific, up-to-date annual turnover percentage for the US beauty industry. Most available research focuses on turnover intentions rather than actual turnover rates 12.
Comparison to Other Sectors: The beauty industry’s turnover patterns are similar to other service sectors, where annual rates often exceed 30–40% 4.
Conclusion
The beauty industry is characterized by high turnover intentions, driven by job stress, limited advancement, and low support. While actual US turnover rates are not precisely reported, available evidence suggests they are likely high and comparable to other service industries.

Client demographics greatly influence retention rates.

-Clients aged 25-45 with higher disposable incomes are more likely to become repeat customers.
-Women tend to have higher retention rates compared to men in salons offering beauty and hair services.
-Urban areas often see higher retention due to accessibility and availability of services.
-Clients who live closer to the salon are more likely to return frequently.
-Personalized services, such as targeting specific client groups with customized offers, can improve retention rates.

## Industry Revenues

### Recent Market Performance (2023-2024)
- **2023 Industry Revenue:** $275,738 million
- **2024 Industry Revenue:** $259,127 million
- **Revenue Change:** -6.0% decline (-$16,611 million)

### Analysis of Revenue Decline
The significant revenue decrease in the Hair, Nail & Skin Care Services industry raises several strategic considerations:

**Potential Contributing Factors:**
- **Consumer Spending Patterns:** Reduced consumer willingness to spend on personal care services
- **Industry Relevance:** Possible declining relevance or changing consumer preferences
- **Market Saturation:** Increased competition from new industry entrants creating price pressure
- **Economic Conditions:** Broader economic factors affecting discretionary spending

**Strategic Implications:**
- Customer retention becomes even more critical in a declining market
- Differentiation strategies (like loyalty programs) may be essential for maintaining market share
- Focus on customer lifetime value rather than just acquisition in a shrinking market

## Cost of Goods

### 2024 Cost Structure Analysis
- **Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** $62,659 million
- **Labor Costs Component:** $78 million (0.12% of total COGS)
- **Non-Labor COGS:** $62,581 million (inventory purchases and other costs)
- **Gross Profit:** $196,468 million

### Gross Profit Margin Trends
- **2024 Gross Profit Margin:** 75.82%
- **2023 Gross Profit Margin:** 75.37%
- **Margin Change:** -0.45 percentage points (worsened)

### Cost Analysis and Strategic Implications

**Cost Structure Insights:**
- Predominantly non-labor costs (99.88% of COGS)
- Rising input costs relative to pricing power
- Margin compression indicates cost management challenges

**Potential Drivers of Margin Decline:**
- **Increased Input Costs:** Labor costs and inventory purchases rising faster than pricing
- **Competitive Pressure:** Companies lowering prices without corresponding cost reductions
- **Market Saturation:** Reduced pricing power in competitive environment

**Strategic Considerations for Loyalty Programs:**
- Margin pressure makes customer retention more valuable than acquisition
- Need to maximize revenue per existing customer rather than competing on price
- Loyalty programs can justify premium pricing through enhanced value proposition
- Focus on increasing customer lifetime value to offset margin compression

## Operating Expenses

### Operating Expense Trends (2023-2024)
- **2024 Operating Expenses:** $178,233 million (68.78% of revenue)
- **2023 Operating Expenses:** $186,785 million (67.73% of revenue)

### Operating Efficiency Analysis

**Concerning Trends:**
- Operating expenses increased as percentage of revenue despite revenue decline
- Indicates poor operational leverage and expense control challenges
- Suggests industry-wide overhead "creep" without corresponding revenue growth

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Fixed Cost Burden:** High fixed costs (rent, salaries) cannot be easily reduced with revenue decline
- **Expansion Overhead:** Growing overhead costs from previous expansion not aligned with current revenue
- **Competitive Pressure:** Unable to maintain expense discipline while fighting for market share

**Strategic Implications for Loyalty Programs:**
- **Operational Efficiency Focus:** Loyalty programs must demonstrate clear ROI to justify additional operating expenses
- **Revenue Maximization:** Critical need to increase revenue per customer to improve expense ratios
- **Cost-Effective Customer Retention:** Digital loyalty solutions can provide better cost efficiency than traditional marketing
- **Fixed Cost Leverage:** Higher customer retention helps spread fixed costs (rent, salaries) across more stable revenue base

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Before the Problem Started
**2023 Industry Performance (Before the Decline):**
- Industry Revenue: $275,738 million
- Gross Profit Margin: 75.37%
- Operating Expense Ratio: 67.73% of revenue
- Employment: 731,121 workers
- Average Weekly Wage: $634

#### What "Normal" Looks Like
**Healthy Industry Signs (Based on 2020-2023 patterns):**
- Revenue Growth: Stable to positive growth expected
- Gross Margin: 75-76% range (consistently good)
- Operating Expenses: 67-69% of revenue (manageable level)
- Employment Growth: 1-3% annual growth
- Wage Growth: 1-2% annual increases

#### How 2024 Compares to Normal
**2024 vs. What We Expected:**
- Revenue Performance: -6.0% (much worse than normal)
- Gross Margin: 75.82% (still good, slightly better)
- Operating Expenses: 68.78% (higher but manageable)
- Employment: 1.8% growth (healthy, normal range)
- Establishment Count: 2.1% growth (154,244 businesses - positive growth)

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Clear Signs of the Problem
**Confirmed Problem Signals:**
- Revenue Decline: -6.0% decrease ($16.6B revenue loss 2023-2024)
- Cost Control Issues: Expenses increased as % of revenue (67.73% to 68.78%)
- Industry Struggles: Revenue declining while employment/businesses still growing
- Expense Pressure: Unable to cut operating costs when revenue dropped

#### How Big is the Problem
**Size of the Impact:**
- **Big Problem**: $16.6 billion industry revenue loss in one year
- **Moderate Concern**: Operating expenses taking bigger share of revenue (1.05% increase)
- **Good News**: Employment growth (1.8%), new businesses opening (2.1%)
- **Financial Health**: Profit margins stayed strong (75.82%)

#### Why This is Happening
**Likely Reasons for the Problem:**
- **Customer Spending Changes**: People spending less on beauty services
- **Too Much Competition**: 154,244 businesses competing for fewer customers
- **Rising Costs**: Hard to reduce expenses like rent (10.54%) and wages (19.77%)
- **Price Wars**: Businesses cutting prices to compete
- **Economic Conditions**: Broader economy affecting beauty service demand

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment (Loyalty Program Implementation)
- **Financial Resources:** Industry gross margin of 75.82% provides capacity for investment, but operating expenses at 68.78% of revenue indicate tight budget constraints
- **Human Resources:** Industry employment growth of 1.8% and average weekly wages of $645 suggest stable workforce capable of training, though high turnover rates (30-40% typical in service sectors) may impact program continuity

#### Capability Assessment (Organizational Readiness)
- **Financial Capability:** Strong gross margins (75.82%) indicate financial capacity, but rising operating expenses (68.78% vs 67.73% in 2023) suggest need for careful cost management
- **Customer Relationship Capability:** Industry retention benchmarks of 50-65% (6 months) and 60-75% (12 months) indicate existing customer relationship foundation, with customer lifetime values of $1,200-$3,500 showing established service relationships

#### Risk Assessment (Implementation Challenges)
- **Financial Risks:** Revenue declining (-6.0% industry-wide) while operating expenses increasing creates ROI pressure - loyalty programs must demonstrate clear returns to justify investment
- **Competitive Risks:** High market saturation (154,244 establishments competing) means competitors may quickly copy successful loyalty programs, reducing differentiation advantage
- **Operational Risks:** High industry turnover rates (30-40% typical) could disrupt program consistency and customer experience quality
