CLV: target 30% increase
client churn rate: target 60% to 40% ]

**Example metrics:**
- Cost reduction: [Target amount or percentage]
- Time savings: [Target time reduction]
- Quality improvement: [Target quality score]
- Customer satisfaction: [Target rating or score]
- Employee engagement: [Target survey score]

### Qualitative Indicators

[improved client satisfaction surveys
relationship managment touchpoints]

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
[client churn rate
annual CLV
revenue retention]

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
[Document current performance levels for comparison]

**Metric 1:** [CCR] = [60%]
**Metric 2:** [CLV] = [$150]
**Metric 3:** [Appointment Frequency] = [2 visits per year]

### Data Collection Plan
[Checking churn rate at 2 6 month periods (Clients Lost in Period ÷ Clients at Start of Period) × 100
Calculating CLV per client at end of year
Calculating average appointment frequency at end of year
Gather customer feedback through survey responses]

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
[A decrease of 10% client churn rate]

### Target Performance Level
[40% CCR, $195 CLV, 3 visit frequency ]

### Stretch Goal
[A decrease of 25% client churn rate ]

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
[Success critera met]

### Employee Success Measures
[Staff memebers have more bookings and better client relationships]

### Customer Success Measures
[Improved client provider relationships and loyalty incentives ]

## Risk Indicators
[Seeing less than 10% decrease in CCR and CLV after six months]

### Red Flags
[CCR droincreases above baseline 
customer satisfaction scores decrease
no show rates increase
staff turnover rates increase during implementation
negative community feedback]

### Mitigation Triggers
[no improvement in retention metrics after six months 
staff productivity drops below baseline 
implementation costs exceed budget by 25%]

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
[Employee training  
client feedback
repeat bookings]

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
[CCR and CLV]

### Long-term (6-12 months)
[Reaching target goals for CCR, CLV, and Appointment frequency
managment culture and strategy mindset 
employee strategy mindet 
overall customer satisfaction]

## Reporting Framework
[Through meetings or reported metrics over email monthly]

### Dashboard Metrics
[CCR, CLV, Apt Freq]

### Regular Reports

CLV
Apt frequency
staff and client satisfaction scores ]

### Milestone Reviews
[After six, and twelve months]
