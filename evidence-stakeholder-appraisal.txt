# Stakeholder Evidence: Quality Assessment
# How good and reliable is the beauty industry research?

## Overall Evidence Quality Assessment

### What Research Sources Were Used

#### How Reliable Are the Sources?
**Main Sources Used:******
- IBISWorld Beauty Industry Report (2025) - Very reliable commercial research company
- Mintel Personal Care Consumer Report (2025) - Very reliable consumer research company
- Bureau of Labor Statistics QCEW data - Most reliable (government data)
- Bizminer Industry Analysis - Quite reliable industry financial tracking
- Sephora case study (LoyaltyLion) - Somewhat reliable industry publication
- Beautiful Co. case study (Square) - Somewhat reliable company case study

#### How Much Does the Research Cover?
**Market Research Coverage:****
- IBISWorld: Complete $68.6B beauty industry analysis covering 167,000 businesses
- Mintel: Large US consumer study covering different age groups and demographics
- BLS: Complete government employment data for beauty industry (NAICS 8121)
- Case studies: Two examples - big company (Sephora) and small business (Beautiful Co.)

**Geographic and Customer Coverage:**
- National US market data (IBISWorld, Mintel, BLS)
- Customer groups: Women 55+, Men 35-54, Adults 18-44, different generations
- Business sizes: Large retail (Sephora: 25M global members) and small salon (16 employees)

### Potential Problems with the Research

#### Where the Sources Might Be Biased
**Business Research Limitations:****
- IBISWorld: Business-focused so may be overly optimistic about growth
- Mintel: Focuses on buying behavior, may miss service relationship aspects
- Case studies: Only show success stories - don't include failures
- Industry publications: May promote loyalty programs to sell services

**What Makes the Research Stronger:****
- Government data (BLS): Very unbiased, follows standard methods
- Multiple sources: Market research + case studies + government data all agree
- Consistent classification: All financial data uses same industry definition (NAICS 8121)

#### Time Period Issues
**Why Recent Data Helps:**
- 2025 reports show current market and customer behavior
- Includes post-pandemic recovery trends
- Covers economic uncertainty effects on customer loyalty

**Time Period Limitations:**
- Only looks at 5 years of trends, no longer history
- Case studies from different time periods (Sephora: 2007-2023, Beautiful Co.: recent)
- Fast-changing digital behavior may make some data outdated quickly
### Do the Sources Agree With Each Other?

#### Where Different Sources Say the Same Thing
**Strong Agreement Patterns:**
- Customer retention problem: 67% first-visit loss matches industry revenue decline (-6.0%)
- Loyalty programs work: Both case studies get 95% retention, IBISWorld shows success too
- Customer loyalty exists: 70% stable customers (Mintel) matches case study retention rates
- Market growing: 5.0% growth (IBISWorld) fits with consumer spending data ($768 annual)

**Small Disagreements:**
- Industry hiring more people (+1.8%) but making less money (-6.0%) shows efficiency problems
- Customers want local (30%) but big retailers like Sephora/Ulta still dominate

#### Where Business and Customer Needs Match
- Industry cost pressures (costs up to 68.78%) matches customer price sensitivity
- Customer want experiences (35% use beauty for stress relief) matches premium service trends
- Technology needs (industry requirement) matches customer research behavior

### How Much Can Each Type of Evidence Be Trusted?

#### Market Research Evidence
**IBISWorld Analysis - Very Trustworthy:**
- Complete industry financial data with clear methods
- Well-known market research company with good reputation
- Specific numbers that can be used (5.0% growth, $68.6B market size)
- Uses government data which makes it more reliable

**Mintel Consumer Research - Very Trustworthy:**
- Large consumer study with age group breakdowns
- Well-established research company and methods
- Specific behavior percentages (70% loyalty, 30% switching, 35% stress relief use)
- Age group analysis helps us know who to target

#### Case Study Evidence
**Sephora Case Study - Quite Trustworthy:**
- Long-term program (2007-2023) shows it works over time
- Specific numbers given (95% retention, 17M members, 80% of sales)
- Published by third party (LoyaltyLion) so somewhat independent
- Large scale proves loyalty programs work for big companies

**Beautiful Co. Case Study - Somewhat Trustworthy:**
- Shows small business can get 95% retention too
- Square case study has good details but company wrote it themselves
- Only one location and short timeframe limits how much can be generalized
- Success factors match industry best practices (personal attention, follow-up)

#### Government Data Evidence
**Bureau of Labor Statistics - Most Trustworthy:**
- Standard government data collection with clear methods
- Employment and wage data (1.8% growth, $645 weekly wage) give industry context
- NAICS 8121 classification keeps industry definition consistent
- Regular data collection allows us to see trends

### What Information Has Good Coverage?

#### Areas With Strong Knowledge
**Market Background:** Complete industry size, growth, employment, and financial performance
**Customer Behavior:** Detailed age group preferences, loyalty patterns, and spending reasons
**Proof It Works:** Two case studies showing loyalty programs work for both big and small businesses
**Money Available:** Industry profit margins (75.82%) and customer spending ability ($768 annual)

#### Areas With Partial Knowledge
**Implementation Problems:** Limited details on specific operational barriers beyond general cost concerns
**Competition Analysis:** Basic understanding of major players but limited competitive strategy details
**Technology Needs:** General understanding of technology importance but minimal specific requirements
**Staff Training:** Know training is important but limited specific program details

#### What Information Is Missing
**Regional Differences:** Limited geographic analysis beyond national averages
**Seasonal Patterns:** Minimal data on seasonal beauty service demand changes
**Failed Program Examples:** No case studies of unsuccessful loyalty program attempts
**Small Business Money Details:** Limited specific cost-benefit analysis for smaller businesses

### How Useful Is This Evidence for Making Decisions?

#### Really Useful for Decisions
**Market Opportunity Proof:** Clear evidence of $68.6B market with 5.0% growth supports investment decisions
**Customer Problem Proof:** 67% first-visit loss rate quantifies the retention challenge
**Solution Works Proof:** 95% retention rates in both case studies prove loyalty programs work
**Target Customer Identification:** Specific age groups (Women 55+, Adults 18-44) with behavior patterns

#### Somewhat Useful for Decisions
**Money Capacity:** Industry margins (75.82%) suggest investment ability but lack business-specific analysis
**Implementation Guidance:** General success factors identified but limited specific operational details
**Risk Understanding:** Customer switching behavior (30%) identified but how to prevent it underspecified

#### Areas Needing More Evidence
**Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Need specific return on investment calculations for different business sizes
**Implementation Timeline:** Need detailed phases and milestone planning
**Technology Platform Choice:** Need comparison of loyalty program software options
**Staff Training Programs:** Need specific training content and time requirements

## Overall Evidence Quality Rating

### What's Really Good About the Evidence
1. **Multiple Reliable Sources:** Mix of established research companies, government data, and real-world examples
2. **Everyone Agrees on the Problem:** Strong agreement across sources that retention is a challenge and loyalty programs work
3. **Specific Numbers:** Clear percentages and financial data that can be used to make decisions
4. **Different Customer Types:** Detailed analysis of different age groups helps target implementation
5. **Works for Any Size Business:** Case studies prove approach works for both big companies and small businesses

### What's Not So Good About the Evidence
1. **Only Success Stories:** Case studies only show wins, missing implementation challenges and failures
2. **Missing Implementation Details:** Strong big-picture evidence but limited step-by-step guidance
3. **Generic Money Analysis:** Industry-level financial data doesn't tell us what specific businesses should invest
4. **National Only:** National data may not reflect what happens in specific regions
5. **Fast-Changing Industry:** Beauty industry changes quickly, research may not keep up

### How Confident Can Decision-Makers Be?
**Overall Confidence:** High
**Why:** Multiple reliable sources all say the same thing about both the retention problem and loyalty programs working. Financial data shows the industry can afford to invest, and customer research tells exactly who to target. While more details are needed for implementation, there is a strong foundation for strategic decisions.

### Recommendations to Make the Evidence Even Better
1. **Find Failure Examples:** Research unsuccessful loyalty program attempts to understand what can go wrong
2. **Create Business-Specific Money Models:** Make return on investment calculations for different salon sizes and service types
3. **Look at Regional Differences:** Check local competition and customer differences by area
4. **Compare Technology Options:** Research specific loyalty program software and integration needs
5. **Small Business Cost Details:** Get detailed implementation cost breakdown for independent salons and small chains
